Secrets and config data go to ~rknop/decatview_secrets

This is to reduce the probability of the web server reading it.  Of
course, the wsgi daemon process can read it still....

Need to create a wsgi process group.  Do this by editing the apache
config and putting in the 000-default-ssl.conf, inside the
<VirtualHost _default_:443> section:

   WSGIDaemonProcess decatview user=raknop group=raknop processes=2 threads=15 display-name=%{GROUP}
   WSGIProcessGroup %{ENV:PROCESS_GROUP}
   SetEnv PROCESS_GROUP "%{GLOBAL}"

The SetEnv tells the server that unless otherwise specified, WSGI
scripts should run under the "global" process group (i.e. as user
www-data within the regular apache process).

Then, in the .htaccess file of the directory you need

   SetEnv PROCESS_GROUP decatview

That, with the other configuration above, tells apache to run wsgi files
in this directory under the decatview process group, which will run as
user raknop.
